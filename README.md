# Rock-Paper-Scissors
An interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the visitor plays against a robotic arm that mimics human hand movements.   Using computer vision, the camera detects the user’s hand gesture, and the robotic arm responds by selecting and performing its move (rock, paper, or scissors) mechanically.
