## 📅 Project Timeline & Context

- **Event:** FMEE 2025 – **AI & Robotics Club** Open Day
- **Date:** November 10–11–12, 2025

## 💡 Project Overview

An interactive **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game where the visitor plays against a **robotic arm** that mimics human hand movements.  
Using **computer vision**, the camera detects the user’s hand gesture, and the robotic arm responds by selecting and performing its move (rock, paper, or scissors) mechanically.

This project demonstrate a hybrid interactive experience that blends **simple sensing** with **advanced gesture technology**.  
The robot can play in two different modes:

1. **Simple Mode:** A PIR motion sensor triggers randomized robotic moves.  
2. **Advanced Mode:** A Leap Motion Controller detects the player’s hand gesture and the robot responds intelligently.



A microcontroller drives the robot’s mechanical movement, while software interprets gestures and decides the robot’s move.  
The result: a flexible platform that showcases both simple sensor-based behavior and high-precision 3D motion tracking.
