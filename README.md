# 🤖 Rock-Paper-Scissors Robot

An interactive **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game where the visitor plays against a **robotic arm** that mimics human hand movements.  
Using **computer vision**, the camera detects the user’s hand gesture, and the robotic arm responds by selecting and performing its move (rock, paper, or scissors) mechanically.

## 💡 Participant Profile
A collaborative project developed by passionate makers integrating **AI, robotics, and embedded systems** to create an engaging and educational interactive experience.

---

## 💡 Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to merge **computer vision** and **robotics** to enable real-time gesture recognition and physical interaction.  
By using a **camera**, the system identifies the player’s move, processes it through a **Raspberry Pi**, and sends commands to an **Arduino-controlled robotic arm** to execute the corresponding move.

## ⚙️ Components and Parts Used
- 🧠 **Raspberry Pi** – handles image processing and gesture recognition  
- 🤖 **Arduino** – controls the robotic arm movements  
- 🔌 **Servo Motor Driver Circuit** – drives the servos safely  
- 💪 **Servo Motors** – move the arm and fingers  
- 🎥 **Camera** – captures the player’s hand image

---

## 💻 Software and Tools Used
- 🐍 **Python** – main programming language for image processing  
- 👁️ **OpenCV** – for gesture recognition using computer vision  
- 🔧 **Arduino IDE** – for programming and controlling the robotic arm
